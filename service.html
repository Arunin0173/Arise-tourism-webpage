          <p class="card-text">Norway? Yes, way. The Scandinavian country offers a diverse array of breathtaking topography, from green-capped mountains and deep coastal fjords to pebble-lined beaches and sky-slicing glaciers. Its capital of Oslo, surrounded by water and forests, also welcomes wellness-minded visitors from all over the world with opportunities to swim, hike, kayak, and ski—all without having to venture too far from its city center.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> Caribbean island can (and should) find a permanent home on this list, there is, perhaps, no beach in the region that rivals the baby powder-like sand and turquoise waves of Turks and Caicos. The once-desolate cluster of islands is now a certified vacation hot spot, brimming with luxurious accommodations, snorkeling reefs, and open-air restaurants along its astonishing clear-water coastline.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> American tourists. While these areas are undeniably beautiful beach escapes, they only represent a small fraction of Mexico’s most beloved natural gems. This includes, but isn’t limited to 67 federally protected national parks, over 5,000 miles of coastline, and less populated regions such as El Vizcaino for whale-watching and Copper Canyon—a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Chihuahua—for hiking. It is four times larger (but equally as stunning) as the Grand Canyon..</p>

          <p class="card-text">Whether it’s the Gothic architecture of Paris (such as the newly reconstructed Notre Dame Cathedral) or the lavender fields of Provence, there is no shortage of sights that will leave even the most jaded of travelers speechless. A venture to the country’s Mediterranean coast is also a summertime must, as beaches along the French Riviera attract mega-yachts as beautiful as the ocean they sail on.</p>

          <p class="card-text"> Australia boasts one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world with a whopping 40 identifiable and distinct eco-regions that range from rainforests and outback deserts to mangroves and the iconic Great Barrier Reef. A stay at the latter may require a boat or helicopter, but even that trip is nothing short of spectacular with over 900 islands to see either from above or among its lapis water-lined cays.</p>

Those searching for safari animals (or any wildlife, for that matter) will remain mouth agape by South Africa’s abundance of living things. A trip to Kruger National Park to witness the “Big Five” (lions, elephants, rhinos, leopards, and African buffalo) is an itinerary requirement while observing the penguin communities at Boulders Beach proves that every nook and cranny of the country teems with some type of fascinating creature</p>

          <p class="card-text"> Valencia and Malaga, or the ritzy islands of Ibiza and Mallorca, Spain has practically everything you could ever want in a country. It’s also surprisingly mountainous with rolling vineyards, cliffside neighborhoods, and trails at Montserrat—arguably the best day trip you can take from Barcelona with its tiny, monk-inhabited village, impressive art museum, and bouldered, rose-hued peaks..</p>
